# Postkid: API Playground ðŸš€

Postkid: API Playground is a multi-stack backend application designed to empower developers in defining, testing, and monitoring API endpoints through an intuitive web interface. This project demonstrates how a consistent set of features can be implemented across various modern technology stacks, serving as both a functional tool and a technical showcase.

## About The Project

The primary objective of the Postkid: API Playground is to provide a robust, self-hostable environment for API interaction, focusing on developer productivity. This repository contains multiple implementations of the same core application, each built with a different backend technology stack and typically paired with a corresponding modern frontend framework.

This project aims to:
- Ensure consistency in usage, features, and API requirements across all implementations.
- Demonstrate full-stack development expertise using diverse technologies.
- Adhere to rapid development cycles for each stack.
- Promote containerized deployments.

For a deep dive into the project's technical specifications, motivations, and acceptance criteria, please refer to the [**Project Yellow Paper (`docs/YellowPaper.md`)**](./docs/YellowPaper.md).

## Core Features

- **Visual API Testing**: Interactively construct and execute HTTP requests.
- **Collection Management**: Group related API endpoints into reusable collections and projects.
- **Request History**: Log all request executions with comprehensive details for debugging and reference.
- **Variable Management**: Use variables within your requests for dynamic testing.
- **Authentication Support**: Configure various authentication methods for your requests.
- **Multi-Stack Implementation**: Experience the same application built with different technologies.

## Architectural Overview

The Postkid: API Playground follows a modular, multi-stack architecture. While each stack implementation is independent, they all adhere to common principles outlined in `docs/YellowPaper.md` and `docs/architecture/readme.md`. Key shared aspects include:

- **Shared API Specification**: All backends expose the same API contract, detailed in [`docs/Endpoints.md`](./docs/Endpoints.md).
- **Unified Conceptual Data Model**: A consistent data structure is targeted by all stacks, connecting to a shared PostgreSQL database. Details on the data model can be found in the [Data Model Overview section of the Architecture README](./docs/architecture/readme.md#4-data-model-overview).
- **Containerization**: Each stack (backend and frontend) is designed to be run in Docker containers.
- **Gateway Pattern**: Production deployments typically involve an API Gateway (e.g., Nginx) for routing, SSL termination, and load balancing.

### Stack Comparison
For a detailed side-by-side comparison of these technology stacks, including frameworks, ORMs, authentication methods, testing tools, and more, please refer to the [**Technology Stack Comparison Table in the Architecture README**](./docs/architecture/readme.md#6-technology-stack-comparison).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker Engine (latest stable version recommended)
- Docker Compose (typically included with Docker Desktop)

### Running a Stack (General Approach)

Each technology stack is self-contained and can be run independently using Docker. While specific commands for a particular stack might be found within its dedicated documentation or a future monorepo setup, the general approach using Docker Compose is as follows:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/api-playground.git # Replace with the actual repository URL
    cd api-playground
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a specific stack's directory or the root (if using a monorepo with top-level compose files for each stack):**
    The project structure may involve individual `docker-compose.yml` files per stack (e.g., `stacks/django-react/docker-compose.yml`) or a centralized management system if set up as a monorepo. Refer to the specific setup instructions that will accompany each stack's implementation. A conceptual example based on `docs/YellowPaper.md`:
    ```sh
    # Example: If docker-compose.yml is at the root for a specific stack configuration
    # (or navigate to the stack's directory if they are separate)
    # docker-compose -f docker-compose.django.yml up --build
    ```
3.  **Build and run the containers:**
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    *(The `-d` flag runs containers in detached mode. Omit it to see logs directly.)*

4.  **Access the application:**
    The frontend and backend API for the selected stack will be accessible on ports defined in their respective `docker-compose.yml` files (e.g., frontend on `http://localhost:3000`, backend API on `http://localhost:8000`).

*(Note: As the project evolves, precise `docker-compose.yml` configurations and commands for each stack will be finalized and documented within their specific directories or a unified development guide.)*
