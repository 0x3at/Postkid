# Postkid: API Playground ðŸš€

Postkid: API Playground is a multi-stack backend application designed to empower developers in defining, testing, and monitoring API endpoints through an intuitive web interface. This project demonstrates how a consistent set of features can be implemented across various modern technology stacks, serving as both a functional tool and a technical showcase.

## About The Project

The primary objective of the Postkid: API Playground is to provide a robust, self-hostable environment for API interaction, focusing on developer productivity. This repository contains multiple implementations of the same core application, each built with a different backend technology stack and typically paired with a corresponding modern frontend framework.

This project aims to:
- Ensure consistency in usage, features, and API requirements across all implementations.
- Demonstrate full-stack development expertise using diverse technologies.
- Adhere to rapid development cycles for each stack.
- Promote containerized deployments.

For a deep dive into the project's technical specifications, motivations, and acceptance criteria, please refer to the [Project Yellow Paper](./docs/YellowPaper.md).

## Core Features

- **Visual API Testing**: Interactively construct and execute HTTP requests.
- **Collection Management**: Group related API endpoints into reusable collections and projects.
- **Request History**: Log all request executions with comprehensive details for debugging and reference.
- **Variable Management**: Use variables within your requests for dynamic testing.
- **Authentication Support**: Configure various authentication methods for your requests.
- **Multi-Stack Implementation**: Experience the same application built with different technologies.

## Architectural Overview

The Postkid: API Playground follows a modular, multi-stack architecture. While each stack implementation is independent, they all adhere to common principles:

- **Shared API Specification**: All backends expose the same API contract, detailed in [`docs/Endpoints.md`](./docs/Endpoints.md).
- **Unified Data Model**: A consistent data structure, defined in [`docs/Models.md`](./docs/Models.md), is used by all stacks, targeting a shared PostgreSQL database.
- **Containerization**: Each stack (backend and frontend) is designed to be run in Docker containers.
- **Gateway Pattern**: Production deployments typically involve an API Gateway (e.g., Nginx) for routing, SSL termination, and load balancing.

The general system flow is:
```mermaid

    Client[Frontend Client Application] --> Gateway[API Gateway / Nginx]
    Gateway --> BackendA[Stack A: e.g., Python/Django API]
    Gateway --> BackendB[Stack B: e.g., Java/Spring Boot API]
    Gateway --> BackendC[Stack C: e.g., Node.js/Express API]
    BackendA --> DB[(Shared PostgreSQL DB)]
    BackendB --> DB
    BackendC --> DB
    BackendA -.-> Cache[(Optional Redis Cache)]
    BackendB -.-> Cache
    BackendC -.-> Cache
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose

### Running a Stack

Each technology stack is intended to be run independently using Docker. While specific instructions might vary slightly per stack (and would ideally be in a README within each stack's own subdirectory), the general approach is:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/api-playground.git
    cd api-playground
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a specific stack's directory** (once subdirectories for each stack are created):
    ```sh
    cd stacks/django-react # Example path
    ```
3.  **Run using Docker Compose:**
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
4.  Access the application via the port specified in the stack's `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for frontend, `http://localhost:8000` for backend API).

*(Note: The exact directory structure and `docker-compose` setup for each stack will be detailed as implementations progress.)*
