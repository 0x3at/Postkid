### Data Flow Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant G as API Gateway
    participant B as Backend API
    participant D as Database
    participant W as Workers
    participant S as Storage

    U->>F: Create API Request
    F->>G: HTTP Request
    G->>B: Route to Stack
    B->>D: Store Request
    B->>W: Queue Execution
    W->>S: Log Response
    W-->>F: WebSocket Update
    F-->>U: Real-time Feedback
```

*Note: In initial stack implementations, the "Workers" (W) component may represent in-process asynchronous tasks within the "Backend API" (B) rather than a separate distributed worker system. The data flow remains conceptually similar, with results eventually propagated to the frontend.*

## üîí Security Requirements

Security is paramount for an API testing platform that handles user data and potentially sensitive API calls.

### Security Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Internet] --> B[DDoS Protection]
    B --> C[Load Balancer]
    C --> D[Rate Limiter]
    D --> E[Auth Middleware]
    E --> F[Application Layer]
    
    G[JWT Validation] --> E
    H[RBAC Engine] --> F
```

### Authentication & Authorization

#### JWT Token Strategy

- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived (e.g., 15 minutes) for API access
- **Refresh Tokens**: Longer-lived (e.g., 7 days) for obtaining new access tokens without re-authenticating
- **Token Rotation**: Automatic refresh token rotation on use (Inferred)

#### Security Policies

| Policy Type        | Requirement                                       | Implementation                                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Password**       | 8+ characters, complexity requirements            | Bcrypt hashing, strength validation             |
| **Rate Limiting**  | Tiered limits per endpoint type                   | Redis-based sliding window (Inferred)           |
| **Session Management** | Secure token storage and invalidation             | HTTP-only cookies, server-side blacklist        |

### API Security Measures

#### Input/Output Protection

- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted to known origins in production environments
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement using SameSite cookies and CSRF tokens
- **Input Validation**: Rigorous schema validation on all incoming API requests
- **Output Sanitization**: Sanitize all output to prevent XSS and data leakage

#### Network Security

- **SSRF Prevention**: Block unauthorized requests to internal networks/metadata
- **Request Limits**: Enforce limits on body/header size
- **URL Validation**: Whitelist allowed protocols (HTTP/HTTPS only) and validate format
- **Timeout Protection**: Implement configurable timeouts for outgoing requests

### Data Protection Standards

#### Encryption Requirements

- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 minimum
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
- **Key Management**: Industry-standard practices (HSMs, cloud KMS)

#### Privacy Controls

- **PII Minimization**: Collect only minimal essential user data
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for security-relevant events
- **Data Retention**: Configurable policies for logs and data

## üìè Acceptance Criteria

The following criteria define the functional and non-functional requirements for a successful implementation.

### Authentication System

- [ ] Users can register with unique email and password validation.
- [ ] Successful login returns valid JWT access and refresh tokens.
- [ ] The token refresh endpoint correctly issues new access tokens using a valid refresh token.
- [ ] Logout invalidates the user's tokens server-side, preventing further unauthorized access.
- [ ] Rate limiting effectively blocks brute force login attempts.
- [ ] The password reset flow functions correctly from end-to-end, including email verification.

### Collection Management

- [ ] Users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on their API collections.
- [ ] Collection names are unique per user to prevent naming conflicts.
- [ ] Soft delete functionality preserves data integrity for future recovery or auditing.
- [ ] Collections can be marked as public or private, controlling their visibility and shareability.
- [ ] Pagination is correctly implemented for efficient display and navigation of large collections.

### Endpoint Builder

- [ ] Support for all standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS).
- [ ] Users can configure request headers, query parameters, and body content (JSON, form data, plain text).
- [ ] URL validation prevents the submission of invalid or potentially dangerous URLs (e.g., internal network addresses).
- [ ] Variable interpolation (e.g., {{variable}}) within URLs, headers, and body is supported for dynamic requests.
- [ ] Users can configure a timeout for each API request execution (e.g., 1-30 seconds).

### Request Execution

- [ ] HTTP requests are executed correctly with the specified method, headers, and body.
- [ ] The response status, headers, and body are accurately captured and displayed.
- [ ] The execution time of each request is measured and logged.
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling is in place for network errors, timeouts, and invalid responses.
- [ ] Rate limiting on API execution prevents abuse (e.g., 10 requests per minute per user).

### Request History

- [ ] All API request executions are logged with their full context (request details, response, timestamps).
- [ ] Users can only access their own execution history.
- [ ] Pagination and filtering (by method, status code, date) work correctly for history logs.
- [ ] Large responses in the history are truncated appropriately to ensure efficient display and storage.
- [ ] A configurable log retention policy is enforced (e.g., logs older than 90 days are archived or deleted).

### Security & Performance

- [ ] SSRF protection successfully blocks attempts to access internal networks or restricted resources.
- [ ] All protected API endpoints require proper authentication and authorization.
- [ ] SQL injection prevention mechanisms are validated through testing.
- [ ] Average response times for CRUD operations are consistently under 200ms.
- [ ] Individual API request executions complete within the user-configured timeout (maximum 30 seconds).
