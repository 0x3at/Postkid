# System Design Documentation

This section is intended to house detailed documents related to specific system design decisions, trade-offs, and patterns used in the Postkid API Playground project. This includes, but is not limited to:

-   **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):** Documents that capture significant architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.
-   **Detailed Design Specifications:** For complex components or workflows that require elaboration beyond the scope of the overall or stack-specific architecture documents.
-   **Integration Patterns:** Descriptions of how different services or components interact.

Currently, this section may serve as a placeholder until such specific detailed design documents are created. Please refer to the `docs/Architecture/` directory for overall and stack-specific architectural details.
